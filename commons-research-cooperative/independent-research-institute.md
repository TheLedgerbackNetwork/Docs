## What is the LCRC?

The LCRC is a distributed research, innovation and education center for collective action and commoning in the contexts of emerging technologies, data sovereignty, systems innovation, mechanism design, and the digital economy. To better understand these contexts, we combine social and technical research with free and open source software \(FOSS\) and other technologies to foster collective action and commoning through the creation of original research, guides, toolkits, courses, commentaries, prototypes, and other materials.

## Vision, Principles & Values, and Mission

In addition to the [Principles and Values](../general-information.md#principles-and-values) in General Information, Scout Cooperative has the following additional principles and values:

* Commons-driven: Building a research commons
* Non-hierarchical Decision-making: Decision-making that supports individual autonomy and collective action
* Diversity: We need and desire diverse people, methods, and approaches
* Complexity: Complexity naturally arises in the DOTS space and should be kept in mind when evaluating topics. 
* Systems Thinking: Don't hate the player, hate the game.
* FOSS: Support and grow FOSS technologies and practices 
* Open Science: Support and grow open access, open data, open scholarship, open peer review, and open publishing efforts, technologies, initiatives, and practices

Vision: Become a globally-recognized theoretical and empirical research, innovation and education center \(aka crowdsourced think-and-do tank\) for collective action and commoning in the contexts of emerging technologies, digital economy, knowledge production, complexity, and mechanism design.

Mission: Foster research, innovation and education on collective action and commoning through and open and collaborative approach.

Goals: 

* developing a scholarly commons for researchers through the use of emerging technologies and radical collective action
* producing theoretical and empirical research that seeks to understand and promote collective action and commoning
* creating educational guides and tools for thinkers, commoners and innovators to help them get their ideas off the ground or transform their existing ideas or collectives

## How does the LCRC work?

LCRC employs an integrative, collaborative research process through collaboration, open-sharing, multifaceted \(interdiscplinary and multidiscplinary\) approaches and accruing benefits from advances in other related areas to navigate strategic opporunties and immplications . The LCRC is primarily a community of _**students, researchers, scientists, academicians, institutions, and businesses**_ committed to learning, educating, and innovating collective action and commoning by combining social and technical research and free and open source technologies.

To this end, the LCRC employs or is planning to employ supportive [resources](resources.md):

#### Laplace Platform

Knowledge-sharing and Collaboration platform that is planned for release by the end of 2021.

#### Thinklusive Journal

Our Collective Action and Commoning Open Access Journal hosted on the PubPub Platform.

The LCRC approach is to conduct research, education and innovation that can lead to the development of primitives, standards, frameworks, protocols, and platforms \("general models"\) that are generally adaptible, greater understanding of insights into markets and how collective action and commoning can be implemented, sustained, and grow, and to increase the number of radical thinkers through educational materials and guidance. 

To assist the growth of collectives and commons, the LCRC relies on creating general models and leaving it to collectives and commons management organizations to implement the models within their own boundaries.

Additionally, complex problems are broken into workable, simpler set of activies which have a well-defined scope and deliverables.

LCRC brings in the concept of **free and open source software, crowd source, cooperativism, open science, interdisciplinary and pluralistic approaches, open innovation** and **product development partnership** concepts in the same organization.

## Operating Rules

The LCRC has formulated basic rules and policies for community governance and knowledge production, summarized in our Operating Rules.

**The Operating Rules cover the following rules and policies:**

* Collective Governance 
* Attribution & Authorship Policy
* Fellowship Policy
* Research Procedure
* Pilot Procedure
* Access Policy
* Operating Rules

## Research Groups

LCRC has been organized into 6 research groups.

## Membership

This section will be further developed as the LCRC becomes an institutional member of other membership organizations.
