# Scout Cooperative

## Background & Purpose

Scout Cooperative is the knowledge and problem-solving arm of Ledgerback in the decentralized and open thinking and systems \(DOTS\) space. At Scout Cooperative, we combine social and technical research with free and open source software \(FOSS\) and other technologies to grow the knowledgebase in this space, to advise projects and individuals in this space to make better decisions,  and to foster the growth of collective action towards more equitable and democratic social and economic outcomes. 

In addition to the [Principles and Values](../general-information.md#principles-and-values) in General Information, Scout Cooperative has the following additional principles and values:

* Commons-driven: Building a commons from our research and supporting commons-based communities
* Non-hierarchical Decision-making: Decision-making that supports individual autonomy and collective action
* Diversity: We need and desire diverse people, methods, and approaches
* Complexity: Complexity naturally arises in the DOTS space and should be kept in mind when evaluating topics. 
* Systems Thinking: Don't hate the player, hate the game.
* FOSS: Support and grow FOSS technologies and practices 
* Open Science: Support and grow open access, open data, open scholarship, and open publishing efforts, technologies, initiatives, and practices
