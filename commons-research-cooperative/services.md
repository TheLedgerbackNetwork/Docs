### Private Report Service

Have the LCRC draft a research report on your behalf that is within the LCRC's focus and scope, that is not meant for public use. With such reports, the user will retain ownership of the research report.

### Knowledge Delivery Service

Our Knowledge Delivery Service will provide you with a remote research department of experienced analysts and researchers who are attuned to your research inquiries, and will help you realize your research goals. 

The Knowledge Delivery Service employs a 6-step process described below to help you breakdown your research questions into smaller, more manageable questions \("_atomizing_"\)_,_ and dive deeper into your data to provide a more thorough analysis. 

The 6-step process:

1. _Brainstorm_: You send over your inquiry and we will start the process of generating research questions
2. _Atomize_: We then atomize the research question into smaller questions which can be worked on simultaneously by our researchers 
3. _Team_: We then bring a team together to tackle these research questions with the size of the team depending on the project and its scope
4. _Analysis_: With our research team in hand, we then scour public databases and indexes using advanced research techniques to solve our atomized research questions
5. _Findings_: Once the research team has completed their analysis, the findings of the analysis are run through a set of  quality-check procedures before being formatted into a clear and unambiguous research brief, tailored to meet any necessary formatting specifications 
6. _Post_: Once the brief is completed, we shall email you the research brief in our default formats \(.docx, .pdf\),  or in any specific formats you require.

Throughout this process, you can stay in contact with the research team via email and/or other messaging applications of your choosing.
