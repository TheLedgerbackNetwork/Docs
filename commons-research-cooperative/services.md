### Services Description

#### Independent Researcher

We offer proofreading, editing and publishing assistance \("publishing services"\) to independent researchers \(academic, industry, citizen\) to aid them in developing and finalizing their original research projects \(generally, not-for-profit research\). For example, if you needed to format your research paper to meet a journal's formatting requirements, we would format your research paper to meet the journal's formatting requirements. 

#### Market Analysis

We offer market analysis, strategic guidance,  and data-sets \("market analysis services"\) to market analysts who need to get an edge over the competition or just getting started in the decentralized and open thinking and systems \(DOTS\) space \(blockchain, decentralized finance, digital identity, etc.\) and want to hit the ground running. 

#### Tailored Research

We offer tailored research services to research-for-hire users who are requesting that the Cooperative, on the user's behalf, draft a research report that covers our focus and scope. With such reports, the research-for-hire user will retain ownership of the research report.

#### Solutions

We offer solutions services to users that are within our focus and scope. Primarily, our solutions are oriented toward governance and enterprise model problems.  

#### Research and Analysis

We offer data/statistics, insights and trends, lists/spreadsheets \("research and analysis services"\) to market analysts \(e.g., consultants and agencies\) through our research delivery method, i.e., _Braintrust service_.  Our _Braintrust Service_ will provide you with a remote research department of experienced analysts and researchers who are attuned to your research inquiries and helping you realize your research goals. 

As part of the _Braintrust Service,_ our research delivery method will help you figure out your research question\(s\) and dive deep into the data to provide a thorough analysis. Our research delivery method is a 6-step process in which we:

1. _Brainstorm_: You send over your inquiry and we will start the process of generating research questions
2. _Atomize_: We then atomize the research question into smaller questions which can be worked on simultaneously by our researchers 
3. _Trust_: We then bring a team of researchers together to tackle these research questions with the size of the team depending on the project and its scope
4. _Analysis_: With our research team in hand, we then scour public databases and indexes using advanced research techniques to solve our atomized research questions
5. _Findings_: Once the research team has completed their analysis, the findings of the analysis are run through a set of  quality-check procedures before being formatted into a clear and unambiguous research brief, tailored to meet any necessary formatting specifications 
6. _Post_: Once the brief is completed, we shall email you the research brief in our default formats \(.docx, .pdf\) or any specific formats you require.

Throughout this process, you can stay in contact with the research team via email and/or other messaging applications of your choosing. 

#### Educators

For educators \(official or unofficial capacity\), we offer content creation, editing and proofreading, assistance, and marketing services \("education services"\) for educational content that falls under our focus and scope. 

#### Content Creators

For content creators, we offer content creation \(articles, infographics, and audio recordings\), creation assistance, and marketing services \("content services"\) for any non-educational content that falls under our focus and scope.
