# Publishing

## Publishing Approach

Our publishing approach guarantees that researchers retain the copyright in their research paper. Our approach to publishing is minimalist, such that the Cooperative only needs the bare minimum rights and permissions to publish and distribute the research paper.

To that end, all Members are only required to give the Cooperative a **copyright license** to publish and distribute the research paper,  and keep a copy of the publication in an open-access repository, regardless of whether the research paper covers the DOTS space. Furthermore, all Members have the option of choosing any reuse license to be associated with their publication.

For non-Members, non-Members are only required to give the Cooperative a **copyright license** to publish and distribute the research paper, and keep a copy in an open access repository, but the research paper must cover the DOTS space. Furthermore, non-members can only choose a Creative Commons reuse license to be associated with their publication.

We do not assess Article Processing Charges \(APC\) for manuscripts by Members, subject to certain limitations. **In exchange for not assessing APC fees, Members are required to contribute yearly to the  Cooperative, e.g., by participating in peer review or being a journal editor.**

We do assess APC fees of $150.00 - $300.00 for manuscripts by Non-members, depending on the particular manuscript \(e.g., length of manuscript, number of authors\).

For non-member authors, the APC fee may be waived under the following conditions:

* The non-member is a co-author of the manuscript with a member, such that the number of member-authors is no less than one-third of the total number of authors;
* The manuscript is of exceptional quality and of great interest to the Cooperative's members;
* The non-member author is an adviser to the Cooperative; and
* The non-member author was invited by the Cooperative to submit a manuscript for publication.
