# Research

Our major production approach to research is the production of original social and technical research, toolkits, analyses, compilations and data that cover decentralized and open thinking and systems \(DOTS\) topics.

DOTS topics include, but are not limited to:

* blockchain, 
* smart contracts, 
* commons-based peer production, 
* mechanism design, 
* game theory,  the commons, 
* social enterprises and nonprofits, 
* organizational theory, 
* peer processes,
* collaborative economy,
* emerging markets,
* emerging technologies,
* identity management,
* data privacy, 
* decision-making,
* governance, 
* token engineering,
* cryptoeconomics,
* Decentralized Finance \(DeFi\),
* Decentralized Privacy \(DePi\),
* Distributed Data Storage,
* Internet of Things,
* Artificial Intelligence,
* Digital Identity \(DID\),
* Federated Social Networks,
* innovation, and
* platform cooperativism.

In the research process, we aim to use publicly-accessible resources \(i.e., not behind a paywall\) s often as possible and crowdsource knowledge from diverse people and disciplines to gain a broader understanding of the area we are researching.

Ultimately, our research productions will be released on an open science basis, such that production \(and associated data\) are easily accessible, adaptable and reusable, with attribution.
