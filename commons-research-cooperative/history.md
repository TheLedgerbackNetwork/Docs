# History

Ledgerback Commons Research Cooperative \(L.C.R.C.; LCRC\) was started as a Cooperative Association in 2018 in Nevada, United States of America.

The founding members of the LCRC were motiviated by three issues in the blockchain industry that they felt were inhibiting societal and business adoption of blockchain:

1. Lack of easy-to-find educational resources about the blockchain industry
2. Rise of scams, theft, and unsavory practices in the blockchain industry 
3. Lack of discussion on blockchain use cases outside of the financial industry.

The LCRC's focus and scope has grown since then as the members have become more knowledge about blockchain use cases, the commons and collectives, and the greater Web3.0 space.

## Major Milestones

### September - December 2018

During the months of September to December 2018, the LCRC accomplished two major goals.
