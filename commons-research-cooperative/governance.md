# Governance

Ledgerback Commons Research Cooperative is a member-oriented, flat organization in which members generally direct the activities of the LCRC. 

The governance of LCRC is divided into two parts:

1. Collective Governance
2. Corporate Governance

## Collective Governance

The member-owners \(in total, the Collective\) are generally in charge of the affairs of the LCRC. 

The Collective Governance process is conducted through the use of Collective Governance Proposals \(CGPs\), which imitate a deliberation process similar to Request For Comments \(RFC\) procedure. 

Generally, CGPs are needed if the action to be taken would have a substantial impact on the Collective or  the LCRC.



## Corporate Governance

### Delegate Board

The Delegate Board \(i.e., Board of Directors\) consists of 7 member-owners who are elected to serve on the Delegate Board by the Collective \(i.e., totality of members eligible to vote\). \(Though, we may switch ot a Collective Delegate Board in the future\)

The Delegate Board also elects two member-owners to be 1\) a secretary, and 2\) financial officer.

The Delegate Board generally oversees the following areas within the Cooperative:

* Budgeting & Financing
* Administration of Programs
* Representing the Cooperative in official matters
* Record-keeping
* Handling Legal matters for the Cooperative

The Delegate Board takes a very hands-off approach to the LCRC, allowing the Collective to govern themselves in most instances. 

### Advisory Board

We are always looking for advisers to assist the development of the Cooperative and on our research projects. 

Our advisers are expected to be knowledgeable in one of the following areas:

* grantmaking
* nonprofit financing
* blockchain
* decentralized technologies
* open science
* open enterprises
* cooperative governance

If you are interested in becoming an adviser, please send an email to hello@ledgerback.coop.
