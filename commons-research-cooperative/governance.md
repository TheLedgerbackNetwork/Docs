# Governance

Commons Research Cooperative is a horizontal, flat organization which gives indivudal members a large level of autonomy. 

The governance of LCRC is divided into three parts:

1. Collective Governance
2. Board of Directors Governance
3. Project Governance

## Collective Governance

The member-owners \(in total, the Collective\) are generally in charge of the affairs of the LCRC. 

The Collective Governance process is conducted through the use of Collective Governance Proposals \(CGPs\), which initate a deliberation process similar to Request For Comments \(RFC\) procedure. 

Generally, CGPs are needed if the action to be taken would have an impact on the Collective or the Delegate Board \(i.e., the LCRC\).

For CGPs, the procedure for proposing, deliberation and approval is as follows:

1. Member drafts a CGP to the Collective to deliberate and approve to change the status from draft to active \(status: draft\)
   1. The length of deliberation, decision-making, and approval will depend on the action to be taken
2. If at least 20% of members signal their intention for the CGP to change status from draft to active, then the CGP will become an active CGP, and thus curating the attention of the Collective.
3. The Collective considers the CGP and deliberates on it, with the Collective having the option of:
   1. Accepting the CGP as-is
   2. Recommending amendments to the CGP
   3. Asking the Author to make amendments to the CGP
   4. Rejecting the CGP as-is
4. If the Collective accepts the CGP as-is or as-modified, then the CGP's status will become official and the CGP will be reviewed by the Delegate Board to ensure compliance and non-interference with pre-determined corporate affairs
5. If the CGP clears the Delegate Board's review, then the CGP's status will be final and it will officially be an act of the LCRC.

Throughout the process, consent-based decision making is utilized.

## Corporate Governance

### Delegate Board

The Delegate Board \(i.e., Board of Directors\) consists of 7 member-owners who are elected to serve on the Delegate Board by the Collective \(i.e., totality of members eligible to vote\).

The Delegate Board also elects two member-owners to be 1\) a secretary, and 2\) financial officer.

The Delegate Board generally handles the following duties within the Cooperative:

* Budgeting & Financing
* Administration of Programs
* Representing the Cooperative in official matters
* Record-keeping
* Handling Legal matters for the Cooperative

The Delegate Board takes a very hands-off approach to the LCRC, allowing the collective to govern themselves in most instances. 

In general, the Deelgate Board will pass resolutions \(DBRs\), with status final, to coordinate and execute upon LCRC mission, principels and values, goals and vision. 

The Collective may revoke a DBR if

The Delegate Board primarily utilizes the following governance frameworks:

* Consent-based decision-making

## Project Governance

Projects in the LCRC are generally created by the Delegate Board or the Collective. 

In either case, the projects in the LCRC are governed in the following manner:

* A team of two or more \(&gt;=2\) members is chosen to collaborate on a project
  * Such determination should be mentioned in the CGP or DBR
* The Team is comprised of at least 2 members to occupy the following roles:
  * Project Lead
    * The member who will lead the meetings and ensure procedure is followed
  * Coordinator
    * The member who will coordinate between the team and LCRC
