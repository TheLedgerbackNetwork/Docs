# General Information

## Brief History

Ledgerback \(specifically Scout Cooperative\) was started as a Cooperative Association in 2018 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The  founding members wanted to tackle issues in the blockchain industry that they felt were distracting from the growth potential for the blockchain industry, and for greater community and local acceptance of blockchain applications:

* lack of educational resources for understanding the blockchain industry
* rise of scams, theft, and unsavory practices in the blockchain industry 
* lack of local discussions on the blockchain industry other than financial and payments use cases

On June 6, 2018, the founding members adopted the Cooperative Bylaws, the rules by which the Cooperative operates and conducts business under. 

During the months of September and December, Ledgerback published the first edition of its Amalgam magazine on Medium, and Ledgerback published its first blockchain market review, _A Preliminary Review of Blockchain in the Music Industry_, on Social Science Research Network \(SSRN\) and Scribd.

## Current Status

As of July 20th, 2019, the total number of members at Scout Cooperative is 10. 

## Principles and Values

Ledgerback's principles and values are inspired by open communities and cooperative-like organizations.

The base principles and values that apply across the network are:

* Decentralization is a spectrum, with our goal to continually decentralize our processes
* Member Empowerment
* No discriminatory behavior on the basis of race, sex, age, ethnicity, national origin, disability, 
* We are in constant development
* Transparency and Openness is the default
* Complexity, uncertainty, and ambiguity are natural occurrences
* One-size fits all approaches are unlikely to be helpful
* Egalitarianism
* Open and voluntary membership
* Democratic member control
* The Commons \(knowledge, documentation, tools, etc.\) should be freely accessible to members

Our principles and values will continue to evolve as time goes on.
