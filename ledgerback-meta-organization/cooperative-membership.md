# Commons

## Why have a Commons?

We believe that by developing a commons \(resources and relationships\), we can enable the free flow of information and practices between members and organizations that will aid the growth of the Meta-organization, and lead to greater progress on achieving the system-level goal.

Additionally, we would like to follow in the footsteps of the organizations that have inspired us a because they made their knowledge, practices and experience freely available to us, and it has been extremely helpful in our development as we develop our Meta-organization.

## Our Commons

The Commons is expected to be comprised of our basic building blocks that we have found influential and have helped steer us in the right direction.

Our Commons will generally be organized in the following categories:

* Collective Knowledge
  * Educational and Training Materials
* Governance 
  * Decision-making protocols
* Resources
  * Tangible Resources
  * Intangible Resources
    * Data
    * Protocols
    * Notebooks
    * Ideas
    * Project Proposals
    * Business Models
    * Templates
* Rainy Day Fund
* Brand
* Infrastructure
  * Collaborative Tools
  * Information & Communications Technologies



OSDD is based on open participation, open peer review, and open source intellectualproperty rights \(IPR\) principles \(Sugumaran2012\). Participants share their results anddata openly in the community commons where the online collaboration andknowledge-sharing platform SysBorg 2.0 plays a central role. OSDD’s commons com-prise a heterogeneous set of physical and intangible resources: biological and chemicaldata, chemical compound libraries, biological samples and assays, research protocolsand lab notebooks, and ideas and project proposals.

In OSDD, anyone who accepts the community’s terms of use can join. **The rules specifyterms for using and contributing data, attribution of scientific results, as well as protocolsfor collaborative interactions.** Individuals and teams of researchers pursue a wide varietyof hypotheses for biological mechanisms and potentially active chemical compounds attheir own choosing, which result in a greater diversity of potential solutions than whatcan be expected from conventional public and commercial research groups. The ability tomobilize a diversity of actors and contributions is particularly useful in a complex and ex-perimental problem solving effort such as OSDD. The OSDD example highlights how acommunity enables a large and diverse set of actors to self-organize in the pursuit of ashared goal by means of shared values, rules, and protocols, as well as shared resources





### Collective Knowledge

Our Collective Knowledge is the accumulation of our general knowledge at Ledgerback that covers the essentials of how we run, and a repository for useful information about DOTS and organizational management. 

We have currently comprised our collective knowledge into a Mindmap, which may be found by clicking on the link below:

#### Education and Training Materials

We plan to create, publish, and disseminate our educational and training materials \(guides, toolkits, books, etc.\) to organizations and members in our Metaorganization so that any and all members and organizations can become knowledgeable in any DOTS area, take action based on these materials, and hopefully so that the public can be better informed about DOTS. 

Educational Materials we currently have out include:

* [Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Guide: A beginner's guide to the blockchain industry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmFROAXhtty59lc-aTG6Pn8XvcOEzZpS/view) 

### Governance & Decision-making

Our Governance & Decision-making rules, procedures, and tools are summarized and described in further detail in our Operating Rules. We decided that having Operating Rules, in addition to our Bylaws, would lead to better governance and decision-making because the Operating Rules are flexible, easily amended, and rarely if ever amend anything related to the Cooperative's Corporate Affairs. 

Currently, we are trying to add innovative governance and decision-making models and tools to our organizations, which will then be included in the Commons as we experiment with them and see their fit for our teams. 

The innovative governance and decision-making models that we are planning to experiment with include:

* Quadratic Voting
* Tokenized Governance
* Sociocracy 
* Consent-based decision-making 
  * Integrative consent
* Implementing the principles of emergent organizations
* Decentralized as needed
* Federalist Distributed Governance \(FD-Gov\)
* Purpose-driven decision-making; and
* Much more!

### Rainy Day Fund

Creating a _Rainy Day Fund_ to support constituent members in need of help. Additionally, to help pool risk when needed.

### Infrastructure

#### Collaborative Tools

We plan to employ collaborative tools that will promote collaboration among our organizations and members so that we can truly achieve our vision of a DOTS-oriented Metaorganization of cooperatives that fosters collaboration rather than pushing people into silos. 

The collaborative tools we are and plan to use include:

* Slack \(internal communications and file sharing \)
* Discord \(voice chat and external communications\)
* Trello \(project management\) 
* Github \(software and file repository\)

#### 

### **Brand** 

We plan to develop a brand that is globally-recognized and respected for supporting, developing, and growing the DOTS space through research, innovation, and purpose-driven organizations.

Our brand is comprised of our name, logo, and designs \(which are described in our Brand Guide\), and our brand is available to any of our organizations and members to use subject to certain restrictions.

_**Logo:**_

_Our logo is a stork, named Scout Stork. Scout Stork is our mascot and we believe represents the DOTS space because storks, throughout history, have been ascribed multiple values, and we believe now is the time for the stork to be recognized for DOTS. Additionally, storks are a species that exhibit swarm intelligence, a trait we believe is critical for the growth of DOTS, and their cultural connotation in the West of delivering babies \(i.e., fertility\), we believe should be further ascribed to include storks delivering DOTS-related knowledge, innovation and tools to every person who comes her way._ 

_The name of our mascot, Scout Stork, comes from the fact we wanted an alliteration for the name, and that Scout can refer to someone who explores a new area to gain information, which we feel we are doing here at Ledgerback with the DOTS space._ 

_**Name:**_

_Our name is Ledgerback. Ledgerback is a combination of "Ledger" and "back." Ledger comes from the term Distributed Ledgers \(which is often used interchangeably with blockchain\). Back comes from the slang term "greenback."_

_We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback as a term arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper \(hence the name greenback\). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on. Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept paper money as money without a second thought. We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, wherein we are moving away from paper money and traditional paradigms to digital money and DOTS-oriented paradigms. The transition period that we are living in will be rocky and shaky like it was for the greenback, but eventually, we see the transition becoming a success and eventually, people will just assume that digital money and DOTS-oriented paradigms are the soup du jour without a second thought, just as we did with greenbacks._
