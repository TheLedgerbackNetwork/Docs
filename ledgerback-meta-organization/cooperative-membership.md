# Commons

### Why have a Commons?

We believe that by developing a commons, we can enable the free flow of information and practices between members and organizations that will aid the growth of Ledgerback, and hopefully provide information that will help inspiring pioneers in DOTS resolve their issues.

Additionally, we would like to follow in the footsteps of the organizations that have inspired us at Ledgerback because they made their knowledge, practices and experience freely available to us, and it has been extremely helpful in our development as we set out on creating a Metaorganization of cooperatives.

We expect the commons to culminate into an organization itself if possible, that may be called Meta Cooperative.

### Our Commons

The Commons is expected to be comprised of our basic building blocks that we have found influential and have helped steer us in the right direction.

Our Commons will generally be organized as:

* Collective Knowledge
* Governance & Decision-making
* Financing & Budgeting
* Collaborative Tools
* Educational and Training Materials
* Brand 

#### Collective Knowledge

Our Collective Knowledge is the accumulation of our general knowledge at Ledgerback that covers the essentials of how we run, and a repository for useful information about DOTS and organizational management. 

We have currently comprised our collective knowledge into a Mindmap, which may be found by clicking on the link below:

#### Governance & Decision-making

Our Governance & Decision-making rules, procedures, and tools are summarized and described in further detail in our Operating Rules. We decided that having Operating Rules, in addition to our Bylaws, would lead to better governance and decision-making because the Operating Rules are flexible, easily amended, and rarely if ever amend anything related to the Cooperative's Corporate Affairs. 

Currently, we are trying to add innovative governance and decision-making models and tools to our organizations, which will then be included in the Commons as we experiment with them and see their fit for our teams. 

The innovative governance and decision-making models that we are planning to internally experiment within our organizations are:

* Quadratic Voting
* Tokenized Governance
* Sociocracy 
* Consent-based decision-making 
  * Integrative consent
* Implementing the principles of emergent organizations
* Decentralized as needed
* Federalist Distributed Governance \(FD-Gov\)
* Purpose-driven decision-making; and
* Much more!

For Sage Cooperative, you will find that the Operating Rules explicitly mention many of the models described above. 

#### Financing & Budgeting

We plan to make our financing and budgeting practices in our organizations as transparent as we can so that our organizations, members, and community are always aware of how we are operating and that we are staying true to our Guiding Principles and Values. 

We also plan to use some innovative financing & budgeting tools as well in our organizations.

An exemplary list includes:

* Cobudgeting 
* Open Collective
* Gitcoin 
* Alternative Financing Platforms
* Decentralized Financing \(DeFi\) Platforms

#### Collaborative Tools

We plan to employ collaborative tools that will promote collaboration among our organizations and members so that we can truly achieve our vision of a DOTS-oriented Metaorganization of cooperatives that fosters collaboration rather than pushing people into silos. 

The collaborative tools we are and plan to use include:

* Slack \(internal communications and file sharing \)
* Discord \(voice chat and external communications\)
* Trello \(project management\) 
* Github \(software and file repository\)

#### Education and Training Materials

We plan to create, publish, and disseminate our educational and training materials \(guides, toolkits, books, etc.\) to organizations and members in our Metaorganization so that any and all members and organizations can become knowledgeable in any DOTS area, take action based on these materials, and hopefully so that the public can be better informed about DOTS. 

Educational Materials we currently have out include:

* [Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Guide: A beginner's guide to the blockchain industry](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmFROAXhtty59lc-aTG6Pn8XvcOEzZpS/view) 

#### **Brand** 

We plan to develop a brand that is globally-recognized and respected for supporting, developing, and growing the DOTS space through research, innovation, and purpose-driven organizations.

Our brand is comprised of our name, logo, and designs \(which are described in our Brand Guide\), and our brand is available to any of our organizations and members to use subject to certain restrictions.

_**Logo:**_

_Our logo is a stork, named Scout Stork. Scout Stork is our mascot and we believe represents the DOTS space because storks, throughout history, have been ascribed multiple values, and we believe now is the time for the stork to be recognized for DOTS. Additionally, storks are a species that exhibit swarm intelligence, a trait we believe is critical for the growth of DOTS, and their cultural connotation in the West of delivering babies \(i.e., fertility\), we believe should be further ascribed to include storks delivering DOTS-related knowledge, innovation and tools to every person who comes her way._ 

_The name of our mascot, Scout Stork, comes from the fact we wanted an alliteration for the name, and that Scout can refer to someone who explores a new area to gain information, which we feel we are doing here at Ledgerback with the DOTS space._ 

_**Name:**_

_Our name is Ledgerback. Ledgerback is a combination of "Ledger" and "back." Ledger comes from the term Distributed Ledgers \(which is often used interchangeably with blockchain\). Back comes from the slang term "greenback."_

_We chose "Ledgerback" based on the history of the slang term "greenback." Greenback as a term arose in the mid-1800s during the US Civil War as the US Federal Government started issuing paper money on green-colored paper \(hence the name greenback\). There was major uncertainty at the time over whether greenbacks would be recognized as banks as legal tender, how much one greenback equated to a piece of gold, and so on. Though this period caused some turmoil, it was a transitional period that has led to our current time where we accept paper money as money without a second thought. We believe we are going through a similar transitional period, wherein we are moving away from paper money and traditional paradigms to digital money and DOTS-oriented paradigms. The transition period that we are living in will be rocky and shaky like it was for the greenback, but eventually, we see the transition becoming a success and eventually, people will just assume that digital money and DOTS-oriented paradigms are the soup du jour without a second thought, just as we did with greenbacks._
