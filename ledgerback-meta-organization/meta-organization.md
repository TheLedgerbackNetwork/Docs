# Meta-Organization

## Meta-organization model ‌ 

A meta-organization is an "organization comprised of a network of firms \[and/\]or individuals not bound by authority based on employment relationships but characterized by a system-level goal" \[1\].

The Ledgerback meta-organization model is meant to proliferate and unite cooperative organizations around a common set of principles and values, practices, and a system-level goal, while infrastructure and vital resources \(i.e., the commons\) is meant to be created and distributed to member organizations to speed up their operations and achieve their goals in a peer production manner.

In the meta-organization, the system-level goal is to push systems innovation \(governance, economics, infrastructure, knowledge-sharing, enterprises, innovation, practices, thinking, etc.\) through the creation and usage of models, systems, thinking and mechanisms that will actuate our principles and values.

In the meta-organization, the organizations behave in a horizontal and egalitarian relationship such that all organizations are treated equally, and no organization has greater authority than another, i.e., a system-wide cooperative governance structure.

Primarily, the organizational structure will be cooperatives, social enterprises, trusts and nonprofits. 

## Advantages of Meta-Organization Model

### Horizontal, Flattened Structure

In the meta-organization, the organizations behave in a horizontal and egalitarian relationship such that all organizations are treated equally, and no organization has greater authority than another, i.e., a system-wide cooperative governance structure.

### Risk Pooling & Combined Resources

In the meta-organization, organizations can balance risk among each other while combining resources such that organizations can pounce on greater market opportunities without further investment in the organization.

### Leverage Competencies

In the meta-organization, organizations can leverage the core competencies of other member-organizations to quickly pounce on business opportunities without having to develop such competencies themselves. 

### Data & Information Sharing

In the meta-organization, organizations can leverage large and varied data from other member-organizations, and share critical information with member-organizations to help improve productivity while not worrying about absence of trust o

### Faster Innovation 

By leveraging core competencies and information from other member-organizations, organizations can trigger innovation in their respective areas and avoid asymmetric learning opportunities because coordination costs are lowered and information is readily shared and stored in the Commons. 

### Adaptive Relationships

In the meta-organization, organizations are not forced into a one-size-fits-all type of relationship with other member-organizations, thereby allowing the relationships to adapt to real-world conditions. 

### Complexity

In the meta-organization, we accept that organizations exist in a complex system and act accordingly to help cope with complexity wherever it arises by leveraging the core competencies of member-organizations, and sharing information among member-organizations.





## Why make a Meta-organization? 

One reason why a meta-organization is needed in this transient time as we move from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 and from the platform economy to the token economy is that to prevent the grievances and misgivings of the legacy systems, we need to develop a base layer of systems that embody cooperative principles and values and governance so that we can avoid centralization, and to ensure that individuals are empowered within the Web 3.0 system through p2p interaction to make changes within the system.

## ‌How does an Organization join the Meta-organization?

Any organization can join the Meta-organization as long as they acquiesce to our principles and values, and patronize the Meta-organization \(similar to how a member patronizes a cooperative\). The primary means of patronage is sharing information, goods, services and resources with the constituent members and growing the commons.
