# Meta-Organization

## Meta-organization model ‌ 

A meta-organization is an "organization comprised of a network of firms \[and/\]or individuals not bound by authority based on employment relationships but characterized by a system-level goal" \[1\].

The Ledgerback meta-organization model is meant to proliferate and unite cooperative organizations around a common set of principles and values, practices, and a system-level goal, while infrastructure and vital resources \(i.e., the commons\) is meant to be created and distributed to member organizations to speed up their operations and achieve their goals in a peer production manner.

In the meta-organization, the system-level goal is to push systems innovation \(governance, economics, infrastructure, knowledge-sharing, enterprises, innovation, practices, thinking, etc.\) that will actuate our principles and values.

In the meta-organization, the organizations behave in a horizontal and egalitarian relationship such that all organizations are treated equally, and no organization has greater authority than another, i.e., a system-wide cooperative governance structure.

Primarily, the organizational structure will be cooperatives, social enterprises, trusts and nonprofits. 

An additional benefit of the Meta-organization is the ability to pool risk among all of the organizations such that organizations can work hard toward the system-wide goal and if one organization does well, then every organization also receives a benefit. 

## Why make a Meta-organization? 

One reason why a meta-organization is needed in this transient time as we move from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 and from the platform economy to the token economy is that to prevent the grievances and misgivings of the legacy systems, we need to develop a base layer of systems that embody cooperative principles and values and governance so that we can avoid centralization, and to ensure that individuals are empowered within the Web 3.0 system through p2p interaction to make changes within the system.

## ‌How does an Organization join the Meta-organization?

Any organization can join the Meta-organization as long as they acquiesce to our principles and values, and patronize the Meta-organization \(similar to how a member patronizes a cooperative\). The primary means of patronage is sharing information, goods, services and resources with the constituent members and growing the commons.
