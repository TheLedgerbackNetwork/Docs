## **Launched**

**Commons Research Cooperative** 

**Vision:** Our Harvest Cooperative gives people access to healthy, local food in a way that honors land and labor. They grow food responsibly, partner with other local growers, and develop innovative solutions to make healthy food widely available. Their goal is that all Cincinnatians will have easy access to healthy food grown by fairly-compensated workers. 

**Our Commons Research Cooperative becomes a glboally-recognized center for research, education, and innovation.**



**Progress:** An incubator urban farm has been operating since April 2012, and additional farm acreage is being leased and cultivated. OHC aggregates produce from other local and regional food producers; supply various retail, wholesale outlets and several hundred families in the Cincinnati area with fresh produce every week; and continue to employ and increase production. OHC is partnering with Cincinnati Stateâ€™s Sustainable Agriculture Management Program; students come to the urban farm weekly for their practicum.
