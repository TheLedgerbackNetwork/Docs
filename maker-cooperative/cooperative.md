# Cooperative

## Background & Purpose

Maker Cooperative is the innovation arm and maker \(such as a creator or inventor; think makerspace\) network of Ledgerback in the DOTS space. Maker Cooperative offers innovation services, consulting and assistance services, transformation services, DOTS-project development services, hiring and recruiting services, event services, prototyping services, and other services. Maker Cooperative will primarily be the cooperative that runs and manages protocols and platforms for Ledgerback. 

Maker Cooperative is expected to be comprised of three types of members:

1. Makers
2. Investors 
3. Clients 
4. Advisors

The Makers are Members \(Trial or Full\) of Maker Cooperative that run and manage the Cooperative, and provide essential services to clients, help develop client DOTS-related ideas, all while prototyping ideas and Proof-of-Concepts that are expected to become a line of business for Maker Cooperative. The Makers are also expected to run and maintain any protocols and platforms, on the cooperative's behalf. 

The Investors are non-members who have contributed to Maker Cooperative by way of purchasing preferred stock in the cooperative or making donations of money or materials to the cooperative.

The Clients are non-members \(who can become members\) who have hired a Maker or Maker Cooperative to provide services.

The Advisors are non-members who have been elected to be advisers to the Board of Directors and help Maker Cooperative steer in the right direction while following the Guiding Principles and Values.
