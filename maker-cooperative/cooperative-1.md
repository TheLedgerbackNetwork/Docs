# Cooperative

## Background & Purpose

Ledgerback Maker Cooperative \(_LMC_\) is a virtual incubator and consulting multi-stakeholder cooperative for supporting entrepreneurs, radical thinkers, and innovators who want to create cooperative and social ventures or integrate blockchain and other Web 3.0 infrastructure into their products and services by offering consulting, incubation, networking, and mentoring services.

In trying to rethink old systems, no idea is too crazy or ambitious to achieve with the LMC at the helm. 

## Vision

The LMC's vision is to develop a dense network of innovators, think-and-doers, entrepreneurs, organizations, and mentors to meet the challenge of training and educating social and cooperative entrepreneurs for the data and token economy \(i.e., industry 4.0\), help these entrepreneurs design their platforms, protocols and organizations with democratic and equitable principles, developing business models for industry 4.0, and help existing businesses integrate Web 3.0 infrastructure into their business and/or convert to a cooperative or social enterprise. 

We believe the models we make here will be adaptable to anywhere in the world and thus lead to the growth of social enterprises in the data and token economies, and the growth of Web3.0.  

## Prototyping

We support our Maker-members by providing a scalable and inclusive system to support Maker-members while they run through the sometimes long and arduous process of prototyping their ideas with a positive outlook such that Maker-members can prototype, fail, learn and try again at faster speeds until they succeed.
