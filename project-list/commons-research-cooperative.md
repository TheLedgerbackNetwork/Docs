## Proof of Concepts

### Databike

Databike is a mobility data governance and token engineering  \(expect some blockchain integration\) project that is being developed in Las Vegas, Nevada by member Charles Adjovu, specifically for electric-assisted bicycles. 

Databike intends to address three issues that are plaguing the mobility \(micromobility, sharing mobility, etc.\) industry and the platform economy in general:

1. Users of Mobility platforms do not have any control over how mobility providers use, share, analyze, and store their data \[1\];
2. Users cannot store their mobility data on their own private devices
3. Users cannot individually share their mobility data with third parties and receive remuneration for sharing their data

Databike intends to resolve the 3 above issues by:

1. Allowing users to store their mobility data on-premise and export to their own private device
2. Allowing users to sell their mobility data to interested third parties in a safe and secure marketplace
3. Allowing users to decide who, when, where, and why there data gets shared. 

Databike plans to do the above by creating a token economics \(i.e., cryptoeconomics\) system that will:

* Incentivize users to generate mobility data by using an electric-assists bicycle and sharing such mobility data with third parties on a secure marketplace

Eventually, with all of the data produced, it should be possible for third parties to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning tools and models to understand micromobility data regarding electric-assisted vehicles. 

#### Current stage

Currently, we are developing a prototype electric-assisted bicycle that can store mobility data on-premise and share such data under appropriate circumstances. 

Concurrently, we are developing a secure marketplace for the sharing of mobility data via blockchain, and creating a token economics system for cycling.

## Research 

### The Solidarity Project

_The Solidarity Project is our comprehensive distributed governance \(DGov\) project that covers the whole DGov space and has the current sub-projects underway:_

* Project Historia \(Governance Ideal-types\)
* DGov Score Framework \(Comparative tool for DGov-related aspects of Organizations\)
* Metacooperative \(Metaorganization comprised of cooperative organizations\)

### Techno-licensing 

The Techno-Licensing Research Report is a comprehensive research report on the business, legal, and automation perspectives \(benefits and drawbacks that may arise\) on automating music licensing via emerging technologies and models such as blockchain and smart contracts, the semantic web, and Ricardian contracts.

### Decentralized Internet Infrastructure

_Our Community Wireless Network project, codenamed "Battle Born Mesh Network," is a Proof-of-Concept project that intends to see if we can create an incentivized mesh network in our local area, with both physical and virtual networks established, that will provide a private network for members and those who are privacy-centric, those who want to control their own infrastructure, and to see if blockchain and smart contracts applied with mesh networks can make mesh networks a viable alternative for local communities who want to control their internet infrastructure._ 

_The current plan for the PoC is to:_

* Read through introductory materials on routing protocols;
* Determine how to establish a physical and virtual network;
* Recruit volunteers to help establish physical and virtual network
* Contact local nonprofits and governmental authorities who would be interested in helping out or assisting the project; 
* Developing a minimally viable mesh network \(MVMN\) in our local community;
* Once we have MVMN, then we shall work on an incentivized scheme via blockchain and smart contracts
